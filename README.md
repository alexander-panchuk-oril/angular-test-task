# ✅ [Angular Test Task] To-Do App 

Dear Candidate, 

We've prepared a simple test task for you where you can show all your knowledge and skills in the Angular area. Feel free to improvise and don't be afraid of challenges 👀. We all believe that you are full of 📚 knowledge and 💪 motivation.

Respectfully, ORIL team.

P.S. If you have any questions 🤔 or just want to chat 💬, please email me at [alexander.panchuk@oril.co](alexander.panchuk@oril.co).

P.S.S. I bet that you could do it with your eyes shut and there is literally nothing that could stop you.

## 📃 Task

Your goal for the task is to show us as much as you know about Angular and Front-End development. The app should be not overcomplicated and you have to remember it's not 🚀 rocket science, so do not overcomplicate everything.

Our (ORIL) goal for the task is to see how deeply you understand the technology and figure out how yoг find solutions in different situations.

For the test task, you have to create your own GitHub repository.

**DEADLINE: 3 days**
